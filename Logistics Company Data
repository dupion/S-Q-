Select all the customer IDs, customer names, and customer emails, as well as the shipping methods each customer used. 
Your results should be in order by customer ID
#1. 
SELECT distinct
customers.customer_ID
,customers.customer_name
,customers.contact_email
,shipments.shipping_method
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN shipments
ON customers.customer_ID = shipments.sender_ID
ORDER BY customers.customer_ID asc
;
(We use a left join because we want all the customer names and emails and the shipping method each customer has used.)

Select all the customer IDs, customer names, customer emails, and shipping methods from the database, but only for the customers we have detailed 
shipping history for (ie, customers for whom we have information in the shipments table). Your results should be in order by customer ID. 
#2. 
SELECT distinct
customers.customer_ID
,customers.customer_name
,customers.contact_email
,shipments.shipping_method
FROM customers
INNER JOIN shipments
ON customers.customer_ID = shipments.sender_ID
ORDER BY customers.customer_ID asc
;

(We used an inner join because we only wanted names, emails, and shipping method for the customers we have detailed shipping history for.)

Select all the customer IDs, customer names, customer emails, and shipping methods from the database, but only for the customers we have detailed
shipping history for (ie, customers for whom we have information in the shipments table), and who have only used the 'Standard' shipping method 
before. Your results should be in order by customer ID.

#3.
SELECT distinct
customers.customer_ID
,customers.customer_name
,customers.contact_email
,shipments.shipping_method
FROM customers
INNER JOIN shipments
ON customers.customer_ID = shipments.sender_ID
WHERE shipments.shipping_method = 'Standard'
ORDER BY customers.customer_ID asc
;

(We used an inner join because we only wanted names, emails, and shipping method for the customers we have detailed shipping history for.
We also used a WHERE clause because we only wanted customers who used the "Standard" shipping method in the past.)
