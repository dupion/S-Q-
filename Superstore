Superstore Database Project
In this project, you'll write your own SQL code to query a Superstore Database that I made. This is an example of data you might work with at a company like Costco etc.

#1. Order the items by price
SELECT * 
FROM superstore 
ORDER BY price;

#2.Show a statistic about the item prices (e.g., average price)

SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price 
FROM superstore;

#3.Show a statistic about the price for items in the category of "Kitchen Supplies"

SELECT AVG(price) AS average_price 
FROM superstore 
WHERE category = 'Kitchen Supplies';

#4.Come up with your own question and answer it using SQL

SELECT COUNT(*) AS electronics_in_stock 
FROM superstore 
WHERE category = 'Electronics' AND stock_quantity > 0;
