Find the names of all the economics courses that are currently being taught.
#1. 
SELECT CourseName
FROM Courses
WHERE Subject = 'Economics'
AND Current = 'Yes' ;

Find the titles of the textbooks currently used in the economics courses. Your results should include the course name and the textbook name.
#2. 
SELECT CourseName, Title
FROM Courses

INNER JOIN Textbooks
ON Courses.CourseID = Textbooks.CourseID

WHERE Subject = 'Economics'
AND Current = 'Yes';

(We use an INNER JOIN because we only need to know about courses that use textbooks.
A LEFT JOIN would give us all courses, whether they use textbooks or not.)

Find the names of the authors who wrote the textbooks. Your answer should include the name of the course, the name of the textbook, 
and the name of the author.
#3. 
SELECT CourseName, Title, Name
FROM Courses

INNER JOIN Textbooks
ON Courses.CourseID = Textbooks.CourseID

LEFT JOIN AuthorTextbookLink
ON Textbooks.TextbookID = AuthorTextbookLink.TextbookID

LEFT JOIN Author
ON AuthorTextbookLink.AuthorID = Author.AuthorID

WHERE Subject = 'Economics'
AND Current = 'Yes'
ORDER BY Name
;

(Answer Notes
We added an ORDER BY so we could more easily see if any authors wrote multiple books.)
